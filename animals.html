                <p>The Main Coon cat has existed in the U.S. since the 1800s, and in fact, it is considered the oldest native cat breed in the U.S. Rugged and solidly built, the Maine Coon cat is known for its massive size, shaggy coat, and large tufted ears reminiscent of a bobcat. The Maine Coon might appear intimidating to some, but this breed is a gentle giant with a sweet, laid-back personality. Brown tabby Maine Coons are perhaps the most recognizable, but the Maine Coon comes in almost any color and pattern, aside from chocolate, lavender, and the Himalayan (pointed) pattern.</p>

                <h2>Hamsters</h2>
                <p>The Syrian hamster, also known as the golden hamster, is among the most popular choices for small pets. It's generally easy to tame, fun to watch, and fairly low-maintenance, making it a good pet for beginners. These hamsters come from arid regions of northern Syria and southern Turkey. Most are golden brown with a lighter belly. But selective breeding has given rise to several variations in color, pattern, and hair length. Thanks to their popularity as pets, diets specially formulated for Syrian hamsters can be found in most pet stores. Plus, their housing doesn't take up that much space and is pretty simple to set up and maintain.</p>
